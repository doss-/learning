MYSQL:
probably it is better to compy ./database/* into mysql image, 
thus create some custom
so it would be available anywhere

PYTHON:
1. parametrize connection string, in some way, do not hardcode it
2. use try to reconnect to MySql in case of fail , at least when err: 111
   2.1 use loop, for X times
   2.2 call method that will try to connect
    2.2.1 handle exception with 111 error here
    2.2.2 return bool with result, true if no exception
   2.3 if no exception, break the loop

update Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml:
	i do tried of rebuild image
	so need to move everything dynamic in the compose
1. made development version, where code is taken from the volume
 1.1 probably leave the dockerfile copy as is? it will be overriden
     by composed volume
2. for development version add ENTRYPOINT python in Dockerfile
 2.1 add command in Compose, with file i want to execute
