MYSQL:
probably it is better to compy ./database/* into mysql image, 
thus create some custom
so it would be available anywhere

PYTHON:
1. parametrize connection string, in some way, do not hardcode it
2. use try to reconnect to MySql in case of fail , at least when err: 111
   2.1 use loop, for X times
   2.2 call method that will try to connect
    2.2.1 handle exception with 111 error here
    2.2.2 return bool with result, true if no exception
   2.3 if no exception, break the loop
