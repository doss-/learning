Interview preps:

Theory: 


networking  
  +how dns works - it asks local cache, then resolver(ISP cache), then root server for TLD address, then TopLevelDomain server for domain address, then authority DNS for A name, and saves IP address in local cache  
(and resolver's cache), then passes that IP to browser to open connection. The asked data will be stored in cache for its TTL time
   +What is A name - Address, IP-Domain pair
   +What is AAAA - Address but higher version
   +WHat is C name - pointer to domain name, there are no Pointer to C name tho
  ports checks basics
   +What is URL record - redirect record
   +What is TTL - time to live, how many seconds record is cached by resolver
  +How NAT works (ports and addresses change on NAT Gateway)
   +Private addresses: Class A (10.0.0.0- 10.255.255.255); Class B(172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255); Class C(192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255). Private addresses are not routed to the internet.  
NAT routers changes pairs of private_ip:port1 to router_ip:port2 , and saves the pairs of those addresses:ports into Routing table, so outer servers always thinks they are talking to Router itself,  
and private computers always thinks they are talking to servers directly (NAT substitues addresses in packages on the fly).
  +What is MAC Address - Network interface Card identifier, MAC is checked by NICinside the network packet header, if it matches NIC's it's accepted, otherwise droppet (if Promisc mode disabled). MAC is the lowest level of layers in networking, it works only in single networ, and wont go over the router, this is where IP comes in play, together with APR layer above it, which searches for Ip of next hop(router of the next network) to pass the original packet with another ip\mac addresses.
MAC also is used in DHCP to identify devices and give IP addresses to them.

  +What is [Forward] Proxy  
  +What is Reverse Proxy

How to bash cli addressing kernel

How piping works, named pipes
 
how terraform inits

find that 2 places where i had to check out the sources:
  find the resources and find docs and find sources with stuff
  how modules work
  passing variables out of module 
  receiving variables into the module
  parametrizing TFSTATE?

AWS:
what is IAM
what is roles
each resource need its permissions, how is it organized
structure of ECS and EC2

A\B testing  
Green BLue Deployments
rolling update

SSL + encoding + handshakes

Practice:  

bash \ powershell
  collection iteration
  env var setting \ getting
  processes get \ kill
  files copy from several dirs with structure save, by extensions
  output save into file
  checks for directory \ file exists

bash cli
  list all processes 
  kill listed processes
  find files by name and date, copy found files 
  archive and compress the files


package management:
 where configs are stored Centos \ Ubuntu
 how to list all packages
 check which binary came from wich file
 search for package by name or part name

....
