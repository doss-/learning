aws:
 Docs:
 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/index.html#cli-aws

 install aws command line interface:
 easiest way is to use pip, which is python package manager:
 
 pip install awscli --upgrade --user
 --upgrade - will upgrade all packages required for awscli
 --user - will install it in user directory so it wont interfee with system libs

==ECS:
 Amazon Elastic Container Service
  basically container management system, which manages its on its own

  Main aspects:
=   Cluster - group of Container instances which act as a single computing 
 	resource
=   Container instance - _ec2 instance_ which was registered to be a part of a 
	specific Cluster. Connects to a cluster using Container agent
	Life Cycle:
	'ACTIVE' and 'connected' - when container agent is connected to cluster
	'ACTIVE' and 'disconnected' - when connection status is 'false'
		when Container Instance is stopped.
		moves back to 'connected' when container agent is able to
		connect to Cluster and able to run the tasks again
	'INACTIVE' - when Container Instance is Deactivated or Terminated
		Such instance is not seen as part of the cluster
=   Container agent - open source application on ec2 instance which ensures that
	ec2 instance can register into Cluster, and runs tasks on the instance
	which is given from a ECS(or cluster..)
	It is included into AMI(amazon machine image from wchi ec2 instance is
	generated), but also could be taken from official amazon git hub repo
	or pulled from docker hub:
	https://github.com/aws/amazon­ecs­agent 
	https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/amazon­ecs­agent/ 
         How To Install:
	https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-install.html
	 Bootstrap container agent:
	https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/bootstrap_container_instance.html#bootstrap_container_agent
	Could be configured through Env vars and Config files, Amazon has
	documentation for all the switches and stuff:
	http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs­agent­config.html 
	Custom config could be created to be used when new container instances 
	are started
=   Task definition - JSON file that describes how docker images should be run
	Basically ;docker compose file on steroids;
	
	Task Definition documentation:
     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html
	
=   Scheduler - decides which instance in a cluster is best to run a task or a
	service
=   Service - long running task such as a web application. Based on a Task 
	definition.
	I can specify how many instances of a Service will run, and ECS will
	ensure that it is running
=   Task - end result of running a tak definition, similar to Service but is not
	running continuously, it is one time job
=   Amazon ECR - private registry (Amazon's docker hub)
=   Amaxon ECS CLI - open source tool for managing ECS through console (like aws)

====IAM
====== User
 User that is not Root(which is the billing holder and stuff). 
  Different users can have different priveleges and acess to different modules.
 Access to resources is given to particular users through Policies
  Like change password is only available if 'IAMUserChangePassword' policy is 
  attached to the user.
 Another way is to add user to a Group which will have its own policies.
  Policy and Group could be created manually in addition to already 
  existing ones
====== Policy
 Permission to do something basically.
  Like change password, or see billing information, or use particular service
  for instance s3
====== Group
 Policies could be groupped into a Group for easier management and consistency
====== Role
 Identity and Access Management Role
