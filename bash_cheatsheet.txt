# Intro

scripts start from instruction which interpreter to use, first line always must
be the directive. Except if script is passed as param into interpreter, then
there is no need in that because there already an interpreter in place.

    #!/path/to/interpreter

i.e.:

    #!/bin/bash

Shortcuts:
  ctrl+a - move to start of line
  ctrl+e - move to end of line
  ctrl+b - move one char back
  alt+b  - move one word back
  ctrl+f - move one char forth
  alt+b  - move one word forth
  ctrl+d - delete one char under cursor
  ctrl+u - delete from cursor to line start
  ctrl+k - delete from cursor to line end
  ctrl+w - delete from cursor to word start
  alt+bcksp - delete previous word
  ctrl+y - paste from clipboard(alt+bckspc deleted)
  ctrl+l - clean screen
  ctrl+r - reverse search in history
  ctrl+j - edit found command in search
  ctrl+p - previous command in history
  ctrl+n - next command in history


Bash Scripts accepts data from stdin and its direct redirection or pipe  
Note: 'read' command need to be used.  

 Example: 
 
    >script:  
    >read -p "enter any *.txt"  
    >echo "${PWD}${REPLY}"  
    $cd ~ && ls test.txt | ./read_and_expect_txt_files.sh  
    /home/dos/test.txt  

 Example:  

    $echo "test.txt" > try.txt  
    $./read_and_expect_txt_files.sh < try.txt  
    /home/dos/test.txt  
	

##Debugging:
    #!/bin/bash -x  
will start debugging tracert - with display of all values expanded and
  lines as bash sees them and will execute them

    set -x  
    echo $var  
    set +x 
 
will enable debugging tracert only between set -/+ x displaying only
 commands in between with such debug info

##shell variables:
$FUNCNAME - contains name of the function being executed(like reflection)  

$PS4 env var, is Promt String for debugging tracert  
$LINENO - is standard variable with line number  
PS4="$LINENO +" - will display line number during debugging tracert  

$OLDPWD - contains previous workind directory  
$RANDOM - contains random number from 1 to 32 767  
$$ - current PID of the programs\script being executed  

##Defensive programming:  

Make sure everything is expanded and is executed in right place:  
 Instead of:  

    $cd $path  
    $rm *  

 Use secure defensive way:  

    [[ -d "$path" ]] && cd "$path" && echo rm *  

where:  
>   - -d - make sure path exists and is Directory  
  - "$path" - in double quotes to avoid null expansion if var does not exist
	it will be expanded in empty string in that way - ""  
  - && - will execute next command if previous returned 0 exit code  
  - echo rm * - will echo expanded by bash shell wildcard, displaying what  
	exactly is going to happen with actual 'rm *'  

##Naming Coventions:
- Variable Names:  
 Lower-case, with underscores to separate words.  
 Ex: my_variable_name  
- Constants and Environment Variable Names:  
 All caps, separated with underscores, declared at the top of the file.  
 Ex: MY_CONSTANT  
 -  Google naming convetions:

#Execution:

  bash searches for entered command in 
 
   1. built-ins
   2. hashes
   3. bash history 
   4. env var PATH  
   4.1. PATH is split by ':' and every path is searched for the command  
   5. new child process of bash created - fork(), and all ENV copied into it
   6. found command is executed in the child copy of bash and replaces it - execve()  
   7. main bash process executes wait() until the child process ends
   8. after child process ends cleanup starts and destroys the process 

  So if script/binary is executed from some(i.e. current) directory and it is
  not in path , it have to be 'source'd like:  

     source scriptname  

>  or:  

     . scriptname  
. is same to source    

>  or:  

     ./scriptname  
this seems to be <current dir>/scriptname (so basically full path, which is also applies)  
 

#Expansion:
 Expansion is done by shell(i.e. bash) and expanded result is passed to shell\command to be executed. If something is escaped by escape sequence, it will not be expanded by shell, and __could__ be expanded by the program receiving escaped sequence.  
 expansion works before pass anything further, so:  

     cp * /some/dir  
 will copy everything from current dir into /some/dir  
  first argument * actually will be passed to cp as list of files matched 
  by wildcard, 'cp' will never see * itself  
  to check what * will return, execute __echo *__  

##variables expansion:
  Expansion starts when $ is encountered.  
  Escape sequences:  
  \ - will escape 1 symbol to treat it as literal and not meta symbol  
  '' - everything between single quotes threated as literals too  
  "" - will expand variables, but escape spaces etc.  
   Variables are expanded before passing them to command so command will only
  see var's value, not its name.  
   Bash creates variable when first mets it, so it will create even empty
  variables, which could lead to errors:  

    foo="/some/file"  
    mv $foo $foo1  # error

>   Bash will create $foo1 variable , then mv will receive $foo1 value which
  is null, and 'mv /some/file <null>' will get error as only 1 param is passed  
   To rename file to __'some/file1'__ use __{}__:  

        mv $foo {$foo}1
   
#Positional parameters:
  Bash supports positional params for the script.  
  default ones are $0-$9 , other params are listed by ${10} and so on:  

-  $0 ---- contains full path of the script being executed  
----	does not count as parameter in list $#  
----	so [ $# -gt 0 ] will return false if $1 is empty  

-  $1+  ---- are actual parameters  

####Parameters are passed as usual  
   Example:  

    script.sh param1 param2
   in script.sh:  

    echo $0  #/path/to/script.sh
    echo $1  #param1
    echo $2  #$param2
    echo $3  # this would be empty uninitialized param with null value
 
####Paraters could be passed using wildcards like 
   Example:  

    script.sh * 	
 will pass everything matched, basically it would be a
		list of files in PWD (same as __echo *__)

###Params Arrays:
   - $# - __.Count__, stores number of arguments passed into the script  
	does __not count $0__ in it, so is not 0 based
   - $* - stores all arguments - ($1 $2 ...), if args has spaces those  
	would be treated as separate params, so params   
	("param1" "param with spaces") would be  
	__$1=param1 $2=param $3=with $4=spaces__  
   - "$*" - all params expanded between ("$1 $2" ...), with delimiter of first
	symbol in $IFS variable, it becomes one single parameter:  
	("param1" "param with spaces") would be  
        __$1="param1 param with spaces"__ (leaving quotes behind in the end)  
   - $@ - same as $*  
   - "$@" - stores all arguments in quotas ("$1" "$2" ...), thus handling 
	spaces in variables.  
  	("param1" "param with spaces") would be  
	__$1="param1" $2="param with spaces"__   
	See 'variable substitution' for more use - ${@:2} (w/o " works same)  


##shift:
  shifts params backwards so $2 would be $1 and old $1 would vanish
  using this command each parameter could be handled one by one  
   Example:  

    while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
     echo "Parameter is $1"
     shift
    done

  This will echo out all parameters given as per shift will consequentially
  move all parameters into $1 position one by one

##basename:
  returns file name from latest node in the path  
   Example:  

    $/home/dos/scripts/some_script.sh
    in script >> echo basename $0
    will return 'some_script.sh'

##dirname:
  returns directory name (everything except latest nodein the path)  
  antipod of `basename`
   Example:

    cd /home/dos/directory/filename
    dirname $PWD
    > /home/dos/directory
  

##variables:
  AKA Global Variables - are visible everywhere in shell environment
   if 'export'ed - will be visible in subshells created from the shell  
   'local' variables are local for funcions - see below  
  is converted to 'String' class by default  
  Initializate variable by = sign w/o leading or trailing spaces  
  Access variable by $  

   Also could be int, if used with 'declare':  

    declare -i variable=1

   COuld be readonly:  

    declare -r READONLY="this is constant, in uppercase by convention"

   Variables definitions:  

    a=z	                    # assign string "z" to var 'a'
    b="a string"            # assign "a string" w/ space to var 'b'
    c="a string and $b"     # expansion works in "" so 'c' value 
                            # is "a string and a string"
    d=$(ls -l foo.txt)      # result of command is assigned to 'd'
    e=$((5 * 7))            # result of ariphmetic result is assigned to 'e'
    f="\t\tastring \n"      # escaped sequences also works in "" here:
                            # \t - tab
                            # \n - new line  

   More than one variable could be declared in 1 line:  

    a=5 b="a string" # will create two variables with
                     # values "5" and "a string", probably 5 is int.ToString()  


  To preserve spaces and stuff use quotas with string vars initialization  
   Example:  

    my_str_var="string w/ spaces goes in quotas"
    echo "stuff is: $my_str_var"   # stuff is: string w/ spa.....
    echo 'stuff is: $my_str_var'   # stuff is: $my_str_var

##arrays:
  also variables, indexed from 0,   
  could have empty indexes.  
   Example declaration:  

    a[10]=Ten	# assign 'Ten' to 11th index in array length of 1  

   Powershell-like thing(or vice versa), except w/o @   

    days=(Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun)
    days=([0]=Mon [1]=Tue ... )    # same as above but with strict indexing
    animals=("a dog" "a cat" "a cow")  

  If array addressed w/o index, index 0 is displayed, if it is null then nothing
  displayed EVEN IF THERE ARE OTHER INDEXES  
   Example:  

    arr=([1]=one [2]=two)
    echo $arr		# nothing returned
    arr[14]=14
    echo $arr 		# nothing returned
    arr[0]=0
    echo $arr		# 0 is returend
    echo ${arr[@]}	# 0 one two 14 is returned

   Example2: assignment of array w/o index specification  

    arr=(a b c d)
    echo ${arr[@])	# a b c d - is returned
    arr=AAA
    echo ${arr[@]}	# AAA b c d - is returned
    echo $arr 		# AAA - is returned

   Example3: deletion of first index w/o index specification  

    arr=(a b c d)
    arr=
    echo ${arr[@]} 	# b c d - is returned
 

 __Iteration:__

  Array variable substitution(see below for strings) arrays could be iterated
  and counted and checked for empty indexes:  
   Iterate array:  

    ${animals[*]} # returns list of values split by space
    ${animals[@]} # same as above  

 Example:  

    arr3=("a first" "a second" 'a third')      # " or ' is fine
    for i in ${arr3[*]}; do echo $i ; done

    >a			# separate variables
    >first		# also separated by spaces(split)
    >a			# will work fine if no Spaces
    >second
    >a
    >third



  "${animals[\*]}" - JOIN joins all elements into 1 string  
 Example:

     for i in "${arr3[*]}"; do echo $i ; done 	# only " , ' will not work
     >a first a second a third                  #joined string

_TODO: CONTINUE FROM HERE_
   
  Best form to use:
  "${animals[@]}" - returns list of values NOT split by space(real contents)
    Example:
   for i in "${arr3[@]}"; do echo $i; done
   >a first		# only different values are separated
   >a second		# spaces are in place
   >a third		# best form to use
 
 Counting:
  Array count coun be calculated, and length of value in single index:
  
 .Count:
  ${#array[@]}     
   where:
  array is var name
   Example:
  echo ${#arr3[@]}
  >3			# there 3 elements 'a first' 'a second' 'a third'
  
 array[i].Length:
  ${#array[i]}     
   where:
  array is var name and i is index to measure length of
   Example:
  echo ${#arr3[1]}
  >8 			# 'a first' is 8 characters long
  
  Check indexes numbers:
   Arrays could have uninitialized or null initialized elements under some
  indexes.
   The way of how to check which indexes are taken is:
  ${!array[@]} 		# works same w/ and w/o double quotes
  ${!array[*]}		# works same as above w/o quotes, 
			# but differently w/ quote, see example below in NOTE:
   Example:
  arr=([1]="a one" [3]="a three" [5]="a five")
  for i in ${!arr[@]}; do echo $i; done  
           "${!arr[@]}"			# will do the same
           ${!arr[*]}			# will do the same
  >1
  >3
  >5

  NOTE: @ works same With or WithOut quotes:
        ${!arr[@]} == "${!arr[@]}
   AND
        * works same as above WithOut quotes
   BUT  
        in double quotes it will JOIN indexes in one string with spaces separators
   Example:
  for i in "${!arr[*]}"; do echo $i; done
  >1 3 5				# produces one line of indexes

 array.Add:
  Arrays could have new elements added into the end of it.
 This is made as in Powershell(or powershell take it from bash) using +=
  Example:
 arr=(a b c)		# echo "${arr[@]}" > a b c
 arr+=(f e g)		# echo "${arr[@]}" > a b c f e g

 array.Sort:
  There is no default sort method, but it could be implemented with
 piping and regular 'sort' command, but with Iteration:
  arr_sorted=$(for i in "${arr[@]}"; do echo $i; done | sort)
	this will save soreted "a b c e f g" into arr_sorted
   !!!! BUT THIS WILL NOT WORK    !!!
   !!!!   echo "${arr[@]}" | sort !!!

 Delete array:
  Deletion of array is done in the same way as deletion of variables
 using 'unset' command.
 DO Not Use '$' in unset.
  Syntax:
 unset array_name

  Example:
 arr=(1 2 3)
 echo ${#arr[@]} 	# check Count - returns 3
 echo ${arr[@]}		# check contents - returns 1 2 3
 unset arr		# deletes arr, NOTICE no '$' before 'arr' NAME
 echo ${#arr[@]}	# cehck Count - returns 0, as for anything unset
			#+ because bash initializes on execution call
 echo ${arr[@]}		# returns nothing


variable substitution:
substitutuin:
   Bash supports various variables substitutions:
  $a - will be substituted with 'a' value
  ${a} - same as $a but could be concatenated w/ string w/o spaces:
    ${a}.txt - will be expanded in a_value.txt
  ${11} - 11th positional parameter given to script from shell
  ${var:-word} - if 'variable' is set, the result will be its value
	if 'variable' is unset - the result will be 'word'
  $(var:=word} - if variable is set results in its value substituted
	if variable is unset, it will be assigned to 'word'
	such assignment will not work for positinal params(see 'shift')
	and other special variables
  ${var:?word} - if variable is unset error with reason 'word' will be
	generated, exit code of such construct will be 1
  ${var:+word} - if 'variable' is set, the result will be 'word',
	(but variable's value will not be changed)
	otherwise result will be EMPTY string
  Example:
	$ echo ${variable:-ls} - variable unset - ls used
	> ls
	$ export variable=1
	$ echo ${variable:-ls} - variable is set- its value used
	> 1
	$ echo ${variable:+ls} - variable is set - ls used
	> ls
	$ echo ${variable1:+ls} - variable unset - empty line used
	> 
  ${!prefix*} or ${!prefix@} - returns NAMES of existing variables
	that starts from 'prefix.
   Example:
   	$ echo ${!BASH*}
	> BASH BASHOPTS BASHPID BASH_ALIASES BASH_ARGC BASH_ARGV BASH_CMDS

string variables substitution:
  ${#var} - returns length of string in variable's value
	Example:
   $ var=123456789   #this could be interpreted as a string too now
   > 9		     #string length is 9

  ${#} or $# or ${#@} or ${#*} - returns number of positional parameters
	of the script being executed

  ${var:number} - return string from number to the end, spaces trimmed
		  variable is unchanged.
	Example:
   $ var="This string is to long."
   $ echo ${var:5}		   #returns string from 5th symbol
   > string is to long.
	Example: spaces are trimmed:
   $ echo ${var:5} | wc -c 	   #count chars
   $ 19
   $ echo ${var:4} | wc -c	   #return starts from space
   $ 19				   #space is trimmed so same number of chars
  ${var: -number} - return string from end to number, spaces trimmed
		    NOTE - space between ':' and '-' signs
	Example:
   $ echo ${var: -5}
   > long.
  ${var:number:length} - return string from number till end of lenth
	Example:
   $ echo ${var:5:6}
   > string
   
  ${var: -number: -length} - return string number between number(from the
			     end) and length (also from the end)
			     NOTE: number must be > than length
	Example:
   $ echo ${var: -18: -2}    #var is This string is to long.
   > string is to lon
  
  ${@} - return all values of positional params 
	 leaving spaces inside strings (like "$@" ) - bcs it know how 
	 many arguments script has
	 ${*} is the same form, it seems

  ${@:num} - displays values of positional params but from num
	 $(@:1) - works same as ${@}
	 ${@: -2} works , but starts from the end

  ${@:num:length} - same as with strings but with positional params
  ${@: -num: -length} - same as with strings but with positional params

  ${param#pattern} - finds shortest match and deletes it (lazy match)
    Example:
   foo="file.txt.gz"
   ${foo#*.}
   >txt.gz
  ${param##pattern} - finds longest match and deletes it (greedy match)
   Example
   ${foo##*.}
   >.gz

  ${param%pattern}  - same as #  but deletes from the end of the file
   Example:
   foo=file.txt.gz
   ${foo%.*} 		- note .* instead of *. in # example
   >file.txt
  ${param%%pattern} - same as ##
   ${foo%%.*}
   >file

    Search and replace:
 ${param/pattern/string} - replaces first occurance of pattern with string
 ${param//pattern/string} - replaces all occurances of pattern with string
 ${param/#pattern/string} - replaces only if at the beginning of the line
 ${param/%pattern/string} - replacesonly if at the end of the line


 $(())
  Accepts any valid arithmetic expression 
   Pretty similar to (()) test construct which returns true when result >0
 Accepts any number system:
  
  Decimal
   with base of 10
  number
   Example:
  echo $((10)) - will return 10
  echo $((10#10)) - will return 10

  Octal: 
   with base of 8 [0-7]
  0number
   Example:
  echo $((010)) is 8 in decimal, where 10 is the whole base, which is 8
  echo $((07)) is 7 in decimal
  echo $((8#10)) is 8 in decimal
  echo $((08)) - will return error 'value to great'
		0-7; 10-17 and so on will work

  Hex: Hexademical:
   with base of 16 [0-9A-F]
  0xnumber
   Example:
  $((0x10)) - is 16 in decimal, which is full base
  $((16#10)) - is also 16, because of base of 16 numbers
  $((16#100)) or ((0x100)) is 256 which is 16x16 or 16 in square(^2)
  $((0xFF)) is F(15) full bases plus F(15) 
		which is ((15x15)==240)+15 == 255

  Custom:
    custom base , could be any number [0-9A-Z] and some other]
    maximum base is 64, seems like
   base#number
    Example:
   echo $((17#10) - is 17, which is full base
   echo $((64#10)) - is 64, which again is full base


  Arithmetic expressions syntax $((arithmetics go here)):
  
    Example:
  echo $((2+3)) >> 5

  IFS - variable that containes field separator, 
	by default is space/tab/new line
	Could be changed

  Temporary variables:
   Bash supports variables change/assignment before command execution
  Variables assigned before command execution (on the same line) will be
  changed only for env with which command will be executed:
   IFS=":" read field1 field2 ... <<< "$line_from_passwd"
    Equals to:
   OLD_IFS="$IFS"
   IFS=":"
   read field1 field2 .... <<< "$line_from_passwd"
   IFS="$OLD_IFS"
  !Note:
   it works weird - only in example from bood, need to research and update

  Unary operators:
   Operators that require value on UNE side, contrary to binary operators
   that reauire values on both sides:
    + - is for positive numbes: +1
    - - is for negative number: -1

  Arithmetic operators: Binary operators:
    there are more binary operators, but those below are used in Arithmetics
  + - for addition
  - - for substruction
  * - for multiplication
  / - for division
  ** - for exponentiation (2*2=4 3*3=9 4*4=16 and so on, aka ^2 ^3 ^4 ...)
  % - modulus division 
	5%2=1 which is what left after division - 2, 2 and 1
      Example:
    echo $(( 5%2 )) - will return 1

  Assignment in Arithmetic expressions:
  echo $((foo=5))  - will assign 5 to $foo
   NOTE: also could be used in tests like [[...]] and ((...))
   NOTE: in 'test' or [...] used to _compare_ strings, BEWARE

  Assignment operators:
   var = value 
	regular assignment operator
   var += value 
	assignment with value addition 		$var = $var + value
   var -= value
 	assignment with value substruction 	$var = $var - value
   var *= value
	assignment with value multiplication 	$var = $var x value
   var /= value
	assignment with value division 		$var = $var / value
   var %= value
	assignment with value modulus division 	$var = $var % value
  
  Assignment with C-like style increment decrement:
   Post - means show\use first, change after it shown\used
  var++ - post increment			$var = $var + 1
  var-- - post decrement			$var = $var - 1
   Example:
   foo=1; echo $((foo++)); echo $foo
  	  1		   2
   Pre  - means change\use first , show after it changed\used
  ++var - pre increment				$var = $var + 1
  --var - pre decrement				$var = $var - 1
   Example:
   foo=1; echo $((++foo)); echo $foo
	  2		   2
   
  
  Basic logical gates:
   AND - returns true if both entry are true
   OR - returs true if at least one (or both) entry is true 
   XOR - returns true if entry differs, 
	 both true and both false return false
   NOT - inverts entry - true is false and false is true
   NAND - both false are true
   NOR - returns true if at least one (or both) entry is false
   XNOR - returns true if not differs,
	  both true or both false return true
   
  Logical operators in Arithmetics:
   Comparison operators less, greater , less than and so on
  <= - less or equal
  >= - greater or equal
  < - less
  > - greater
  == - equal
  != - not equal
  && - AND
  || - OR

  expr1:expr2?expr3 - trinary operator, 
		      if expr1 is true 
		      then expr2 executed
	 	      else expr3 is executed
   Example:
  a=0
  ((a<1?++a:--1)) 	# a+=1 and a-=1 will not work
  echo $a 	 	# 1
  ((a<1?(a+=1):(a-=1))) # but this will work just fine
  echo $a	 	# 0
  

local variables:
  local variables are declared in functions, and visible only there
  local variables overwrite globals with the same name
   Syntax:
  local variable_name[=optional_value]
   values are optional , probably, in order to delete some global vars inside
  a function(i.e. vars are used as standard in\out params of a command)
   Example:
  foo=0
  func() {
   local foo
   foo=1
   echo "in func $foo"
  }
  func
  echo "in script $foo"
   Result:
  >in func 1
  >in script 0

here doc here docs here-document here script :
  allows multiline input and it WILL expand even if in ''.
   But will not expand if escaped - \$
   Syntax:
  command << indicator
  text
  indicator

  <<-  - work as << but accepts TAB before enclosing 'indicator'
	'space' will still return error

   where:
  command is a command like, 'cat' or anything else (doesn't work with 'echo')
  where text between 'indicators' is expanded by shell and sent to STDIN of
  the command
   Note that also <<- could be used, with it bash will ignore leading
  tabs in 'indicator'
   Note that seconds 'indicator' has to be on separate line and 
  Must have no spaces before or after it, otherwise bash interpreter will 
  conntinue to look for 'indicator' ignoring the one with leading/trailing 
  spaces
   Value of 'indicator' could be any but 'EOF' is preffered

   Example:
  $ foo="text"
  $ cat << _EOF_
  >$foo
  >"$foo"
  >'$foo'
  >\$foo
  >_EOF_
   Result:
  text
  "text"
  'text'
  $foo
   
   Example of use with 'ftp'
  ftp -n << EOF
  open $FTP_SERVER_ADDRESS
  user anonymous username@hostname
  cd $FTP_PATH
  hash
  get $REMOTE_FILE
  exit
  EOF
  ls -l $REMOTE_FILE - will display downloaded from ftp remote file, all the
  	commands are passed from inside the here-document

here-line:
  same as here-doc but onliner:
   $read field1 field2 <<< "test in put"
   $echo $field1  ---> test
   $echo $field2  ---> in put  < because put is 3rd field, and we have only 2
				all excess fields goes into last 'field2'
    Profid of here-line here is that commands with pipe
   $echo "test in put" | read   
	will not work because subshell will be created for 'read' where $REPLY
	will be created and assigned, but after that subshell ends, and
	subshell can not change parent shell's env, such as REPLY value
  

if:
  Condition tests in IF should be inside square brackets - [], which are just a
  reference for commant 'test'. see MAN page for TEST for details.
   example:
  if [ 100 -eq 100 ]; then - semicolon is needed in case of single line w/o /n
   -or-
  if [ 100 == 100 ] - seems like this also should work
   -or-
  if $(test $(echo "$REPLY" | grep '^[0-3]$'))
	tests whether value of REPLY is mathced- if not, grep return 1(error)
	then test returns 1 and 'if' will not work
	if value matched then grep returns 0 (good), then test returns 0 and
	'if' will work
   -or-
  if test $(echo "$REPLY" | grep '^[0-3]$')
	same as above, but $() outside 'test' is unnecessary in fact
	but works in both ways so keep both examples here
   -or-
  if [ <some test> ] && [ <other test> ] || [ <yet again test> ]
  then
    <commands>
  elif [ <some test> ]		# else if, onliner gotta be ; ended
  then
    <different commands>
  else				# one liner gotta be ; ended
    <other commands>
  fi

  lots info here:
  https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-if-statements.php

&& ||:
  allowed inside bash shell logical AND and OR:
   Example:
  mkdir test && cd test
   will create and than change dir to 'test'
  [ -d test ] || mkdir test && cd test
   will check whether 'test' exists, returns 0 or 1
   || continues only if 1 was returned by 'test' and proceeds with mkdir
   && continues only if 0 was returned by 'mkdir' and proceeds with cd

test:
  Tests whether expression returns 0 or not
  after evaluation command 'test' returns 1 if true and 0 if false
   test 100 -eq 100 - test whether 100 equals 100
  or [<thing to test>]
   if [ 100 -eq 100 ]
  used to test conditions

  Logical operators:
   -a - AND
   -o - OR
   ! - NOT
    Example:
  [ ! \( FALSE -o TRUE \)   -- (TRUE) but [ FALSE]
   note the escaped parentheses
   note that 'false' and 'true' command will behave differently , bcs returns
  interegs 1 and 0 respectively

  Requires shell expansion symbols $ 
   Example:
  if [ $num1 -lt $num2 ]; then echo 'int 1 less than int2'; fi

  BEWARE!!!!!!
  shell creates empty variable if it is not defined
  and $num1 -lt $num2 will return TRUE if both undefined

  CHECK YOUR VARIABLES BEFORE USE

   Test Strings\Ints:
  Operator 	Description
  ! <expr> 	The EXPRESSION is false.
  -n str 	The length of STRING is greater than zero.
  -z str 	The lengh of STRING is zero (ie it is empty).
  str1 == str2 		STRING1 is equal to STRING2 (= also allowed)
  str1 != str2 		STRING1 is not equal to STRING2
  str1 > str2		STRING1 is alphabetically greater than STRING2
  INTEGER1 -eq INTEGER2 	INTEGER1 is numerically equal to INTEGER2
  -ne				integers are not equal
  -le				are less or equal
  -ge				greater or equal
  INTEGER1 -gt INTEGER2 	INTEGER1 is numerically greater than INTEGER2
  INTEGER1 -lt INTEGER2 	INTEGER1 is numerically less than INTEGER2
   
   Test Files:
  FILE -ef FILE1 - both files are hard links (point to same inode)
  FILE -nt FILE1 - FILE newer than FILE1
  FILE -ot FILE1 - FILE older than FILE1
  -e FILE 	FILE exists.
  -f FILE 	FILE exists and is file
  -s FILE 	FILE exists and its size greater than 0
  -L FILE 	exists and is soft symblic link
  -d FILE 	FILE exists and is a directory.
  -b FILE	exists and is Block device (i.e /dev/sda1)
  -c FILE 	exists and char device
  -r FILE 	FILE exists and the read permission is granted.
  -s FILE 	FILE exists and it's size is greater than zero (ie. not empty).
  -w FILE 	FILE exists and the write permission is granted.
  -x FILE 	FILE exists and the execute permission is granted.
  -G FILE 	exists and file belongs to existing group
  -O FILE 	exists and belongs to existing user
  
   NOTE:
  == - does a string comparision
  -eq - does numerical comparison
  
   Escaping:
  symbols < > ( ) need to be escabed by \ or be between ''
  because [ ] is just command test, and bash will try to use them as its own 
  meta symbols (< > are stdout\in redirecton, so could be a MESS)


[[ ]]:
  improved 'test' command but not POSIX compatible
    Differences\Features:

    Does not need expansion symbol $, expands just fine w/o it
   UNLESS IS A STRING, then use "$VAR", to expand and prevent empty values
    Example:
   $ if [[ $num1 -lt num2 ]]; then echo "$num1 less than $num2"; fi
   > 1 less than 2
    NOTE:
   $num1 and num2 are both fine as per expansion works in some other way
   
   BEWARE OF UNDEFINED VARIABLES
   IF BOTH ARE UNDEFINED 0 WILL BE RETURNED!!

    Can compare regex. 
   Seems like gotta match full line, not just some part.
   uses Extended Regex (ERE)
    Requires $ symbol to expand variable value
    use "" to prevent empty values
   No need to escape bash meta symbols like \ or *
    Example:
   $ if [[ "$string_var" =~ \w+? ]]; then echo "good"; fi
   > good

    Can use wildcards , or similar to it..
   When using == equation
    Example:
   $ FILE=foo.txt
   $ if [[ $FILE == foo.* ]]; then echo "matches pattern"; fi
   > matches pattern

   Logical operators:
   && - AND
   || - OR
   ! - NOT
    Example:
   if [[ ! ( FALSE || TRUE )]]; --- in (will be TRUE) but ! will invert to FALSE
    Note that 'false' and 'true' are not commands, commands return 1 and 0
   and behavios incorrectly


(( )):
  Permits Arithmetic expansion and Evaluation for 
  Works only with Integers (no float dot like in Double or Float types)
   Note:
  bash syntax part, not a command
  also does expansion w/o $ symbol before var name

  Arithmetic expansion examples
   a=$(( 5 + 3 )) or a=$((5+3)) - assign result of addition to variable 'a'
   C style manipulations:
   (( var++ )) or ((var++)) - display then increment by 1
     $(( var++ )) - increments and saves var but also produses errors
   (( ++var ))  - increment by 1 then display
   (( --var ))  - same manner decrement
   (( var-- ))  - display then decrement
   Assignment:
   $((b+=a)) - add 'a' to 'b' and assign result to 'b' - b=$a+$b

   Evaluation:
   if ((10>=5)); then echo "10 greater or equal 5"; fi
      ((var1>=var5))  - same byt with variables
  
  Logical operators:
   same as in [[ ]] - && , || , !

  (()) returns 'true' if integer inside of it greater than 0
   Example:
  dos:bash$ if ((1)); then echo "true"; else echo "false"; fi
  >true
  dos:bash$ if ((0)); then echo "true"; else echo "false"; fi
  >false

  


Loops:
for:
   Has two forms, first is foreach:
    Syntax:
  FOR var IN words; DO 
	commands
  DONE
   var - custom name as in regular foreach
	 usually i j k l m - thanks to Fortran where int vars must start
	 with those letters
   words - is a collection, could be just 1 2 3 4 
	   or result of command
	   or result of wildcard matches list
	   or result of subshell execution
	   if omitted - args passed from commandline
   do and done are the braces
   Example:
  for i in 1 2 3;  do echo "print $i"; done
   > print 1
   > print 2
   > print 3

   Example:
  for file in test*.txt; do echo $file; done
   ># will echo all files from current dir matched by globbed(wildcard) 
	test*.txt mask

   Example:
  for i in $(some commands executed in subshell); do....
 
  If optional 'words' component is omitted in 'for' it uses args(params) as
  collection to iterate through

   Example:
  for i; do echo "command line param 1 is: $1" shift; done
   this will echo out all params of bash script one by one (shift command)

  Second form of 'for' is c-like (like real 'for' in c# and not 'foreach'):
    Syntax:
   for (( expr1; expr2; expr3 )); do
    commands
   done
 
   where 
    expr1-2-3 - are arythmetic expressions
    
    Example:
   for (( i=0; i>5; i++ )); do
    echo "i is $i"		# will output $i from 0 to 4
   done

    This form is equialent to following construction:
   (( expr1 )) 			# this is assigned before loop
   while (( expr2 )); do	# loop goes as long as expr2 is true
    commands
    (( expr3 ))			# at the end of each iteration expr3 is
				#+ reassigned/reevaluated
   done

while:
  infinity loop while exit code of command\expression is 0 
  could read from file(stdin) line by line with STDIN redirect or pipe:
   Syntax:
  while true; do    | while [[ true ]]; do | while (( 1 )); do
   commands
  done
    Example:
   while read field1 field2 field3
    ..
   do < file_to_read_from.txt
    Example:
   cat file_to_read_from.txt | while read field1 field 2 field3; do ... ; done


    example:
  while read host ...; do... - or like this if in 1 line
  do
    ping -c 3 $host
    if [[ $call_continue ]]; then
      continue			 # will pass further iteration and start over
    fi
    if [[ $call_break ]]; then
      break			# break loop and go out of it at all
    fi
  done < myhosts.txt

  

  will read from myhosts.txt while there are lines, each line will reinit $host

  break: will stop loop from execution - just regular break as ususal
  continue: will pass iteration and start next iteration - also standard one

exit status:  
exit code:
  bash scripts ALWAYS returns exit code. 'exit' is optional
  commands ALWAYS return exit code too. 
  Functions ALWAYS return exit code too. 'return' is optional
  seems like everything returns exit code.
  Even bash shell 'exit'ed with number will return this number
  to manually return exit code:
  exit nnn - to return nnn
	!!   nnn - MUST be an INTEGER in range 0-255 !!
  return nnn - to return nnn but from Function
  exit $? or exit or omitting the 'exit':
   with no params exit code is taken from latest command executed in the script
  Variable that contains exit code:
  $? - contains latest exit code, overriden after any next execution
	even 'echo $?' will override it with 0
    Exit code values:
  0-255 allowed
    By convetion
  0 - OK
  1-255 - various errors 

  to test Exit Code:
  echo $? - will return exit code of previous command or value of previously
	    executed script 
  more reading:
  http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exit-status.html

case:
  check whether one of condition matches the 'word' in case, if so it
 executes code in particular case and terminates
  Syntax:
 case $word in		# value of $word will be compared against
  <ptrn1>|<ptrn2>) cmd1 # the <pattern> and if tru command1
	     cmd2   # and command2 will be executed
	     ;;		# this ends particular case block
  *) 	     exit 1     # * match anything, last case 'catch'
     	     ;;		# ends 'catch' block values of '$word' either
			#+ matched by previous cases or this one
			#+ nothing is left 'case' block unmatched this way
 esac			# this ends whole case, after 1 of the cases 
			#+ matched, or none matched
  Example:
 while [[ -n $1 ]]; do 		#while param is not null
  case $1 in			#check param
	-f | --file) 	shift   #take $2 as $1 , if -f, 
				#to get file path given with -f option
			filename=$1
				#save file path to $filename
			;;
  esac
 Case uses wildcards as pattern:
 ? - one character
 * - anything of any length
 [ABC] - 1 letter - either A, B or C
 [0-9] - 1 number in 0 - 9 range - any digin with length of 1
 a - letter 'a'
 *.txt - anything that ends with '.txt'

 Good practice is 

true:
  command that always return 0
   Example:
  exit $(true)   - will return 0 exit code
   or Function:
  return $(true) - will return 0 after Function
   or:
  true   	 - will return 0 exit code
   or Funcion:
  test() {
   true
  }
  test 		 - this will return 0 in script, and if last line - script
		   will return this same 0 to caller (i.e. bash shell)
   Same works for False

false: 
  command that always return 1

help:
  lists all built-in commands
   help <built-in command>
  will return help for that command

shopt:
  SHell OPTions - built-in command to set\view shell options

shell types
  See details:
  https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/129143/what-is-the-purpose-of-bashrc-and-how-does-it-work
  Even more detailed:
  https://askubuntu.com/questions/879364/differentiate-interactive-login-and-non-interactive-non-login-shell
 there are 4 shell types
  Interactive Login shell
    either shell opened via SSH
    or via ctrl+alt+F1(-F6)
  Interactive Non-Login shell
    Opening terminal
    executing 'bash'
  Non-interactive Non-Login
    scripts execution
    or 'bash -c'
  Non-interactive Login
    rare stuff, complex.. should be ssh launched w/o command and STDIN of the
    ssh should has no TTY - echo command | ssh server
    or 'bash -l -c command'

  How to check which shell is:
   echo $-
     if output has 'i' - its Interactive:
   >himBH
   ----
   bash -c 'echo $-'
   > hBc
     NOTE: that double quotes - bash -c "echo $-" still will start interactive
	shell.. probably due to Shell Expansion of variables

   shopt login_shell
   >login_shell off
    will mean that it is NOT login shell
   >login_shell on
    will mean that is IS login shell
 
 Example for each type:
## Interactive, non-login shell. Regular terminal
$ echo $-; shopt login_shell
himBHs
login_shell     off

## Interactive login shell
$ bash -l
$ echo $-; shopt login_shell
himBHs
login_shell     on

## Non-interactive, non-login shell
$ ssh localhost 'echo $-; shopt login_shell'
hBc
login_shell     off

## Non-interactive login shell
$ echo 'echo $-; shopt login_shell' | ssh localhost
Pseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal.
hBs
login_shell     on    

functions:
  shell could have functions, funcions MUST BE declared before its call,
  otherwise shell will interpret funcion names as regular commands
   Functions could be executed and calld from shell, added to scripts or 
  bashrc/profile files so will be available in cmd as regular command
  'return' command in optional
   Function MUST has at least one command, in order to mock\stab 'return'
  command could be used.
   Basically every script could be converted into a function just by
  copuint all the contents after she-bang in between function declaration
  which is in Syntax below. And replace 'exit' with 'return' keywords
   Variables in the Function could be set as 'local' overriding outer
  global variables.
   $0 in fuction contains name of the script being executed
   $FUNCNAME - contains name of the function being executed

   Syntax:
  function name {
    local VAR
    local VAR2=value
    <commands>
    return
  }
   Or equivalent:
  name() {
   <commands>
   return
  }

    Example:
  script.sh:
  function func {
   echo "step 2"
   return
  }
  echo "step 1"
  func
  echo "step 3"
  
   Result:
  >step 1
  >step 2
  >ste 3

   Example .bashrc:
  ds() {
   echo "disk space utilization for $HOSTNAME"
   df -h
  }

   Result after shell restarted 
   (after source .bashrc ds looped and crashed shell):
  $ ds
  > disk space utili....
  > ...output of df -h....
  
|:
  pipe character
  creates new subshell, executes what goes after pipe there, then returns
  back to parent shell. subshell can not change parent shell - so 'read' command
  will not work in pipe

breaking line; new line:
 use \ at the end of the line.
  NO SPACES OR ANYTHING AFTER THE BACK SLASH.
 Guideline: split the long(80 chars) line into two lines.
 Also break the line everytime there is an &&, | or || characters.
 Example:
command1 \
 && command2 \
 || command3 \
 | command4

read:
  reads line from keyboard input, accepts here-strings, does not work with |
  By default saves entered value into $REPLY global variable
   Synopsis:
  read [-params] [variable1 variable2 variable3 ...]

  Accepts more than 1 variable to save keyboard input
   Default separator is space or tab or new line(\n)
  If less variables are given to save data, all excessive data (delimited 
  fields) will be saved in last variable (like msbuild do when too many params)
  When too many variables is given - unpopulated vars remain empty string

   Params:
  -a - array, saves input into the array 
  -d <delim> - delimiter, by default space\tab\newline
  -e - use Readline, behaves like keyboard input in bash
  -n <num> - read num symbols from keyboard input
  -p <promt> - display promt befor cursor on the same line (like bash promt)
  -r - do not inerpret \ symbols
  -s - silent, do not display entered data, like in password field
  -t - time out for wait of entry
  -u <descriptor> - use file with given descriptor as STDIN

Command grouping:
command groups:
 Commands could be groupped, there are two types:
  Groups:
   { command1; command2; [command3; ... ] }
  Subshell:
   (command1; command2 [; command3 ... ])

  Commands in Groups are executed in current shell, so ENV variables 
 chaned during commands execution are saved into current Shell ENV
  Subshells are executed in sub shell and current ENV could not be 
 modified.
 
  Examples:
 ls -l > output.txt
 echo "listing of foo.txt" > output.txt
 cat foo.txt > outpu.txt
  ==
 { ls -l; echo "listing of foo.txt"; cat foo.txt; } > output.txt
  or
 (ls -l; echo "listing of foo.txt"; cat foo.txt) > output.txt
 
 NOTICE:
  Groups must have spaces next to {}, and last command should end with ;
  SUbshells do not need extra spaces and ;
 BUT:
  subshells are taking longer to be executed because of extra subshell
 need to be created. Also more memory is required. 
  Also no parent shell ENV modifications is possible

 Example with pipe:
  { ls-l; echo "listing of foo.txt"; cat foo.txt; } | lpr
 this will redirect output through pipe into 'lpr' which is print command.
  So all the output of 3 commands are redirected at once into 'lpr'
 which is not the same with 
  ls -l | echo "..." | cat foo.txt | lpr - will send only foo.txt to
 print

Processes substitution:
 <(commands list)  - processes sending output to STDOUT
 >(commands list)  - processes getting input to STDIN
  
  Subshell output is interpreted as regular file, and could be redirected
 into another commands as usual.

 Example:
  read < <(echo "foo")
  echo $REPLY - will return 'foo'
 where:
  'read' reads from STDIN, and saves what is read into $REPLY by default
 	 if executed in subshell $REPLY will not be available to 
	 parent shell
		echo "foo" | read - will not work
  <     - STDIN redirection, so STDOUT from <() is redirected as STDIN
	  of 'read' command
  <(echo "foo") - Process substitution, where 'ehco' executed in 
	  	  subshell Group () sends its output to STDOUT.
		In other words output of this part is represented as
		usual file, which is redirected into 'read' STDIN
  echo $REPLY - proves that $REPLY is updated in current shell with
		value redirected out of subshell 
		due to process substitution

  Result of substituted shell is stored as regular file and could be 
 found line this:
  echo <(echo "foo")
  > /dev/fd/63
   Its contents could be listed:
  cat <(echo "foo")
  >foo

trap:
  Event subscription for system signals (SIG..) like SIGKILL etc.
 there are 64 signals, so some variety of situations.
  In general this is the way to trigger script when some system sent some
 particular event to the script

  Syntax:
 trap <command> signal [signal ...]
  Where command is what will be executed in case 'signal' is sent to
 the executing script
 !  Also could be a function.
  
  Example:
 #!/bin/bash
 trap "echo 'i am ignoring you'" SIGTERM SIGINT

 this will return 'i am ...' if SIGTERM (kill -9) or SIGINT (CTRL+C) are
 sent to the script.

  Also works with functions, so like lambda\delegates

   Example:
  exit_on_SIGINT () {
   echo "script Interrupted" 2>&1
   exit 0
  }

  trap exit_on_SIGINT SIGINT

   this will call exit_on_SIGINT() function when CTRL+C is received
   and will redirect 'echo' into both STDERR and STDOUT
  After event is handled, exit 0, will ensure exit of the script, as it
  is expected by the SIGnal

temp files:
random:
  event handling (trap) usually used to delete temp files generated 
 during script work. Such files could contain some secure info and stuff.
  To secure from 'temp race attack' - when temp files being searched
 by 3rd party and read, files need to be named in unobvious way
 which means use random gibberish stuff to mask particular files.
 
 Random could be used like $RANDOM
 $RANDOM var containes random number from 1 to 32 767, but this is not
  really huge number

mktemp:
  command that creates temporary file with name based on pattern
  or directory
   creates 
   Syntax:
  mktemp </path/to/file/some_nameXXXXXXXX>
  mktemp [OPTION]... [TEMPLATE]

   Create a temporary file or directory, safely, and print its name.  
  TEMPLATE must contain at least 3 consecutive 'X's in last  component.   
  If TEMPLATE is not specified, use tmp.XXXXXXXXXX, and --tmpdir is 
  implied. 
   Files are created u+rw, and directories  u+rwx,  minus  umask  
  restrictions.

   this will create file at given path, with every X being replaced
  with random number or letter(random case)
   NOTICE: in general convers 4+ X into random letters\numbers
  and only at the end of the file name
   except if it has extention (like .txt)

   Example:
  #!/bin/bash
  tempfile=$(mktemp ~/.tmp/XXX-$(basename $0).$$.XXXXXXXXX) 
  echo $tempfile
   which will produce:
  script output: >XXX-test.17306.PRsr7hXuU
  $ ll XXX*
  -rw------- 1 dos dos 0 кві  2 03:07 XXX-test.17306.PRsr7hXuU

 Generally it is more safe to use custom temp directory instead of /tmp
  Example:
 [[ -d ~/.tmp ]] || mkdir ~/.tmp
  this will check if ~/.tmp exists, if not will create it
  But in general mktemp also could create directories.. 

Asynchronous
Async async
 Bash could run async commands and tools.
 To run something in background is should ends with &
  Example:
 >copy_script.sh &
  copyscript will now run in background
 $! - returns PID of last started in background process
  Example:
 >pid=$!   - will save PID of running copy_script.sh into pid variable

wait:
 waits for given process to finish, before continue execution
  Example:
 wait $pid - will wait for copy_script.sh to finish before continue

Pipe
pipe
 Pipes are the files created in special pipefs filesystem
  by default unnamed pipe are created for every | symbol in command chain
 in following command 2 pipes will be created:
  ls -l | grep foo | less
 output of 'ls -l' will be redirected into pipeA
 input into 'grep' will be reead from pipeA
 STDOUT of 'grep' will be written into pipeB
 STDIN of 'less' will be read from pipeB

 every command will be executed in subshell, need to clarify more

mkfifo:
  creates Named pipe, which is stored as a file in regular file system
   Syntax:
  mkfifo /path/to/file
   To write into named pipe:
