  DESIGNED TO UNDO LOCAL COMMITS

   --hard - moves state of all 3 Git Trees (DANGEROUS)
	Working directory
	Staging area
	Commit history
   --mixed  (default) - moves state of 2 Trees
	Staging area
	Commit history
   --soft - moves state only of 1 Tree
	Commit history

   In case of --hard reset all the data will be wiped out
	w/o possibility to restore it
   Mixed reset clears staging area, moving everything from there
	back to Working directory tree, so changes are there and
	not lost
   Soft reset moves only Commit history back, and everything
	that was staged remains staged, and everithing that 
	whas edited but not yet added , remains also

   Example:
     reset foo.py - resets foo.py leaving it only in Working tree

     reset HEAD~2 - moves HEAD back for 2 commits, using --mixed
	flag as default



git revert:
  creates new commit which will be added to the history
	_after_ the commit to which user want to revert
