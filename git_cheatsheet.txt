clone:
  clones repository locally , later parent repo could be reached as origin
 clone locally:
  this will allow have repo and working local branch on the same machine

  git clone <username>@localhost:/path/to/repository <local dir name>

git reset:
  moves HEAD and Branch(e.g. Master) pointers to previous commit
   Unlike revert it does not create new commit, just moves pointer
  to a previous commit (or any other if specified)

  DESIGNED TO UNDO LOCAL COMMITS

   --hard - moves state of all 3 Git Trees (DANGEROUS)
	Working directory
	Staging area
	Commit history
   --mixed  (default) - moves state of 2 Trees
	Staging area
	Commit history
          Example:
     git reset HEAD~    -- moves back one commit:
      HEAD~ or HEAD^ means the commit before head 
     git reset <hash of the commmit TO MOVE TO! >
   --soft - moves state only of 1 Tree
	Commit history

   In case of --hard reset all the data will be wiped out
	w/o possibility to restore it
   Mixed reset clears staging area, moving everything from there
	back to Working directory tree, so changes are there and
	not lost
   Soft reset moves only Commit history back, and everything
	that was staged remains staged, and everithing that 
	whas edited but not yet added , remains also

   Example:
     reset foo.py - resets foo.py leaving it only in Working tree

     reset HEAD~2 - moves HEAD back for 2 commits, using --mixed
	flag as default



git revert:
  creates new commit which will be added to the history
	_after_ the commit to which user want to revert

  DESIGNED FOR UNDO PUBLIC COMMITS

git ls-files:
  debugging util , displays all the files and their hashes
	if file has been moved from Working to Stage the
	hash will change

   -s  - stage, displays only staged stuff

git rm - removes files, adds to staging area
  -r - recursivelly
  --cached - removes from index (but need to confirm 
   wtf it does)

git mv - rename/move files , adds to staging area


gitignore:
 Seems like it applies right after file save, why did i
think i need to commit it first? weird
/**/.terraform - will ignore all .terraform folders anywhere
 or 
.terraform/ - should do the same

/**/*.tfstate - will ignore all .tfstate files anywhere
