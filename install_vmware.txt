get .bundle file 

make sure everything installed like
 kernel-headers, kernel-devel, kernel, gcc, make (list is for Fedora distro)
if anything from above missing, better reboot after install

 add executable permissions for .bundle file:
# chmod +x ./VMware-Workstation-Full-12.5.9-7535481.x86_64.bundle
 execute bundle:
# sudo ./VMware-Workstation-Full-12.5.9-7535481.x86_64.bundle

 make sure important files are in place(version.h is optional probably)
# cp /usr/src/kernels/`uname -r`/include/generated/uapi/linux/version.h /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/linux/
 NOTE: path to version.h could vary, do search first:
 find / -type f -name version.h 
 add some libs into vmware libs from installer, for some reason
# cp -r /usr/lib/vmware-installer/2.1.0/lib/lib/libexpat.so.0 /usr/lib/vmware/lib

 this is applicable only if /usr/lib is not already for x64 platform
# cd /usr/lib/vmware/lib/libz.so.1
# mv -i libz.so.1 libz.so.1.old
# ln -s /usr/lib64/libz.so.1 .

Now everything is ready, but probably kernel version differs from one 
which VMWare expects, so need to untar and fix differences manually, 
or just download already fixed sources
No matter of choice sources still need to be recompiled.

sources are here:

>>>> https://github.com/mkubecek/vmware-host-modules/releases

 For VMWare 12.5.9 with uname -r returning '4.15.0-46-generic' use 
 'w12.5.9-k4.15' where w - workstation and k.... - kernel version

 ungzip  downloaded modules and copy vm*-only folders into VMWare sources:
 and compile
GO TO HERE
# cd /usr/lib/vmware/modules/source/vmmon-only ; make
# cd /usr/lib/vmware/modules/source/vmnet-only ; make

add misc dir into kernel modules:
# mkdir -p /lib/modules/`uname -r`/misc

copy some compiled stuff into kernel's modules and generate dep files
# cp /usr/lib/vmware/modules/source/vmnet-only/vmnet.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/misc
# cp /usr/lib/vmware/modules/source/vmmon-only/vmmon.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/misc
# depmod -a

vmware is ready to go

HERE: except modules still not loaded correctly.

so instead of compilation, backup old 
vmmon.tar 
vmnet.tar


and copy over new tars
cp -r <path>/vmware-host-modules-w12.5.9-k4.15/vm* /usr/lib/vmware/modules/source/
cd /usr/lib/vmware/modules/source/
sudo tar cf /usr/lib/vmware/modules/source/vmmon.tar vmmon-only
sudo tar cf /usr/lib/vmware/modules/source/vmnet.tar vmnet-only

then reconfigure vmware  and restart machine:
sudo vmware-modconfig --console --install-all  
sudo reboot

to enable Promiscuous Mode
 it is not works usually as per VMWare installed by root, but you are not 
root, and VMWare is started from under you, and can not access files that
are owned by root exclusively

groupadd vmnet		- create new group
usermod -aG dos vmnet	- add user to the group
 relogin
groups			- check gropus of the user
groups dos		- check again - should be the same list
echo /dev/vmnet*	- make sure not changing anything else vmnet0-vmnet8
chgrp vmnet /dev/vmnet* - change ownership of the group from root to vmnet
chmod a+gw /dev/vmnet*	- add rw acces for users from the group ownership

start VMWare, it will be started from under 'dos' user and virtual machine 
that needs Promisc mode will get it throught that now /dev/vmnet* devices
has read\write access for users in the group vmnet, to which 'dos' belongs
