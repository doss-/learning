# Server example

```
server {
  listen 3000;

  location / {
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html index.htm;
  }
}
```

Where:
- nginx will listen for port 3000
- requests coming to `/` will have root of `/usr/share/nginx/html`
- index would be either `index.html` or `index.htm`

# Reverse Proxy example:

```
upstream client {
  server client:3000;
}

upstream api {
  server api:5000;
}

server {
  listen 80;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://client;
  }
```

Where:
- two upstreams (machines behind the reverse proxy)
-- with server located at machine with `api` and `client` hostnames
-- those servers are axpected to listen at ports `3000` and `5000` respectively
- reverse proxy server itself will listen at port 80
- requests coming to root `/` will be passed to `http` of machine with `client` hostname
