how to change PYTHONPATH:
http://ask.xmodulo.com/change-syspath-pythonpath-python.html

read\write files 
open('file_path') - opens for 'r' - read, 'r' is default second param
 others:
 'w' : use for writing
 'x' : use for creating and writing to a new file
 'a' : use for appending to a file
 'r+' : use for reading and writing to the same file

stream = open('file/path', 'r')
stream.read() - entire contents as String
stream.readline() - one line and moves cursor forward
stream.readlines() - all lines left after cursor, returns List[string]
stream.close() - need to close unmanaged resources, can only read from 'r'
stream.write() - writes only string w/o carriage return
