Install:
RHEL 6/7 :
Centos7:
https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-python-3-on-centos-7/

Software collections library, allows multiple versions of same software.
to enable its repos:
  sudo yum install centos-release-scl
to install python36
  sudo yum install rh-python36

to enable python36 for current sessioN:
  scl enable rh-python36 bash

to enable for current user:
  vim  /home/<username>/.bashrc 
   Add following:
  # Add Python 3.6 from RHSCL to my login environment
  source scl_source enable rh-python36
Virtual env / venv:
could be stored in separate directory, i.e. in root of project directory
  mkdir ~/my_new_project
  cd ~/my_new_project
  scl enable rh-python36 bash
  python -m venv my_project_venv
   activate virtual env:
  source my_project_venv/bin/activate
   shell will be prefixed with env:
  (my_project_venv) user@host:~/my_new_project$




types:
  Bool:
   True
   False
  nothing:
   None - usefull when need to declare empty(not initialized) variable
	Example:
    variable = None
    while (not variable):
      variable = True

not:
  like ! in c#\ruby
   if (not varTrue) == if(!varTrue)

print:
  2.7
   print "this is string and this is ",variable
   print 'Hello World! I have been seen {} times.\n'.format(count)
  3+
   print("this is string and this is",variable)
   print("test value: {}".format(value))

if:
  if 1>2:
    print "this will never print"

whiel:
  wile True:
    print "this will print forever"


read\write files 
open('file_path') - opens for 'r' - read, 'r' is default second param
 others:
 'w' : use for writing
 'x' : use for creating and writing to a new file
 'a' : use for appending to a file
 'r+' : use for reading and writing to the same file

stream = open('file/path', 'r')
stream.read() - entire contents as String
stream.readline() - one line and moves cursor forward
stream.readlines() - all lines left after cursor, returns List[string]
stream.close() - need to close unmanaged resources, can only read from 'r'
stream.write() - writes only string w/o carriage return


exception handling:
  try:
    {try code}
  except <lib.namespace.ExceptionClass> as <var_name>:
    {catch code}

pip:
  python libraries manager
   DO NOT UPGRADE PIP WITH PIP --upgrade option
  https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5221

 install:
   installs libraries
   -r <file_name>- requirement, takes required packages from a file
	each package name on new line
	 Example:
	Flask   	- will install Flask
	Flask==0.10.1   - will install Flask of given version
 search whether package is installed:
 ALSO NOTICE THAT PIP3 and PIP ARE TWO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WITH DIFFERENT
 PACKAGES (i believe)  
   sudo apt-get install python-pip
  OR
   pip list <package_name>

mysql+python:
  mysql-connector-python - contains mysql libs for work with database
   how to work with DB:
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-example-connecting.html
  
  nice example of PYthon+Mysql in DockerCompose

Web Frameworks:
  Flask - small and easy, almost nothing included, does the job, has many custom 
	libraries to close the gap. Good for little projects
  Django - has everything, good for large projects
