Lambda
 Process Beacon Provisioning
Probably API GateWay
IAM Role
 IoT VPC (all for Lambdas + IoT) > for 3 lambdas IoT
 Lambda (all for Lambdas) > for 1 lambda Gateway
Investigate IAM Lambda permissions
 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html#intro-permission-model-access-policy 
Probably also need to create IoT Analytics Channel, if required 



GENERAL TODO
1. complete provisioning of Topic Rules
 1.1 Create IoT Analytics if required
2. create API GateWay+Lambda
3. create IAM roles required
4. Create diagram with terraform resources for visualisation
