introdution blogs about:

O'Railly - also has a book lol

installation:
 download archive from official site https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
 unzip and move to /usr/bin/terraform. Make sure has +x chmod
 create new user in AWS IAM with enough access(i.e. admin)
 add access key and secret key into ~/.aws/credentials:
  [terraform]
   aws_access_key_id = ""
   aws_secret_access_key = ""
 create main.tf
  initialize provider, region, and path to credentials file along with which
  profile to use:
   provider "aws" {
    region                  = "eu-west-3"
    shared_credentials_file = "/home/eon01/.aws/credentials"
    profile                 = "terraform"
   }
 execute 'terraform init'


basic syntax:
resource "<resource strict type>" "<custom name in terraform>" {

resource "aws_instance" "web" {

  #<attributes list. Key = value>
  #attributes are specific for each type

 ami = "ami-9a562df2"
 instance_type =  "t2.micro"
  # special Terraforms variable - cout
 count = "4"
  # if used at the end of the resource, and equals to 0, terraform will skip
  # resource creation
  # TODO: recheck above, it was somewhere in the links above, i believe


}

resource "aws_elb" "web" {
 # ... other attributes

  # create links between resources - load balancer is linked to ec2 instance
 instances = ["${aws_instance.web.id}"]
  #this will add ec2 instance created above into load balanced cluster of ELB
  #if there are several instances in 'web' index need to be used
  #or just *:
  # instances = ["${aws_instance.web.*.id}"] - will return id of every instance

resource types are strict and could be any of AWS or other cloud provider things
like:
 aws_instance - ec2 instance
 aws_elb - aws ELB thing

custom name could be any
it is visible only in terraform, not clund providers, so only for terraform


==PLAN
+ - indicates creation of resource
- - destroyed resource
~ - resource updated in-place (w/o destroying)
-/+ - destroyed and newly created resource

terraform plan - will read main.tf and display what is gonna happen

-var - adds/override variables into main.tf (like Properties in MSBuild)
	key-value pairs. 
	Could override existing variables
	Need add '-var' before every new entry
   Example:
  terraform plan -var region=eu-central-1 -- will override default variable
	'region', when it has us-west-1
	in Plan output it could be seen by using different AMIs
   Example1:
  terraform plan -var region=eu-central-1 -var profile=default

==APPLY

executes the .tf script creating stuff described in the file

--------------
Learn:

Parametrization:
 -Variables
 -Outputs

Interpolation Funcions:
something like work with strings - change, parse, cut etc. built-in terraform
engine

Modules:
encapsulates(seems like even private) configuration: DRY and shareble

Remote State:
