O'Railly - also has a book lol

installation:
 download archive from official site https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
 unzip and move to /usr/bin/terraform. Make sure has +x chmod
 create new user in AWS IAM with enough access(i.e. admin)
 add access key and secret key into ~/.aws/credentials:
  [terraform]
   aws_access_key_id = ""
   aws_secret_access_key = ""
 create main.tf
  initialize provider, region, and path to credentials file along with which
  profile to use:
   provider "aws" {
    region                  = "eu-west-3"
    shared_credentials_file = "/home/eon01/.aws/credentials"
    profile                 = "terraform"
   }
 execute 'terraform init'
 Note: to use exact version of terraform add this into the main.tf:
 terraform {
  #this will not install 0.9.5 but install any 0.9.3 and up
  required_version = ">= 0.9.3, != 0.9.5"
 }

-var-file=/path/to/file.tfvars
  pass variables from another file splitting execution and parametrization
   Example:
  variables.tfvars:
   my_ami = {
    us-east-1 = "ami-0ff8a91507f77f867"
    eu-central-1 = "ami-0233214e13e500f77"
   }
  main.tf:
   variable "my_ami" {
    type = "map"
   }

Example of the Terraform file to create VPC, subnets, tables and stuff:
https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1851
Example of ssh key application:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46099329/error-with-keys-when-running-terraform-apply

  So values are taken from the file .tfvars, other parts of the variable is 
  still in main.tf - its type "map" for instance.


basic syntax:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html

resource "<resource strict type>" "<custom name in terraform>" {

resource "aws_instance" "web" {

  #<attributes list. Key = value>
  #attributes are specific for each type

 ami = "ami-9a562df2"
 instance_type =  "t2.micro"
  # special Terraforms variable - cout
 count = "4"
  # if used at the end of the resource, and equals to 0, terraform will skip
  # resource creation
  # TODO: recheck above, it was somewhere in the links above, i believe


}

resource "aws_elb" "web" {
 # ... other attributes

  # create links between resources - load balancer is linked to ec2 instance
 instances = ["${aws_instance.web.id}"]
  #this will add ec2 instance created above into load balanced cluster of ELB
  #if there are several instances in 'web' index need to be used
  #or just *:
  # instances = ["${aws_instance.web.*.id}"] - will return id of every instance

resource types are strict and could be any of AWS or other cloud provider things
like:
 aws_instance - ec2 instance
 aws_elb - aws ELB thing

custom name could be any
it is visible only in terraform, not clund providers, so only for terraform

syntax bullet point ref:
   - Single line comments start with #

   - Multi-line comments are wrapped with /* and */

   - Values are assigned with the syntax of key = value (whitespace doesn't matter). The value can be any primitive (string, number, boolean), a list, or a map.

   - Strings are in double-quotes.

   - Strings can interpolate other values using syntax wrapped in ${}, such as ${var.foo}. The full syntax for interpolation is documented here.
     (https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/interpolation.html)

   - Multiline strings can use shell-style "here doc" syntax, with the string starting with a marker like <<EOF and then the string ending with EOF on a line of its own. The lines of the string and the end marker must not be indented.

   - Numbers are assumed to be base 10. If you prefix a number with 0x, it is treated as a hexadecimal number.

   - Boolean values: true, false.

   - Lists of primitive types can be made with square brackets ([]). Example: ["foo", "bar", "baz"].

   - Maps can be made with braces ({}) and colons (:): { "foo": "bar", "bar": "baz" }. Quotes may be omitted on keys, unless the key starts with a number, in which case quotes are required. Commas are required between key/value pairs for single line maps. A newline between key/value pairs is sufficient in multi-line maps.
   - Also maps could be like this, for ease of reading:
  variable "ami" {
    description = "the AMI to use"
  }
   Is equal to:
  variable = [{
    "ami": {
      "description": "the AMI to use",
    }
  }]

Variables syntax:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html

AWS Policy Variables
 have same syntax as Terraform, to avoid errors AWS variables
 need to be escaped with extra $ :
  ${aws:username} ==> $${aws:username}

 Way to use and configure AWS policies in Terraform could vary, 
 several implementations are available:
  https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/guides/iam-policy-documents.html#choosing-a-configuration-method

variable "foo" {
  #this block configures single input variable
  #name(foo) is used to assign value via CLI (-var 'foo=bar' )
  # and reference the variable eleswhere

  #arguments Optional:
  type = "type" 
   #defines type of variable, valid values:
   #string, list, map
   # if absent type will be according to default param value
   # if no default is provided either - then will be string

  default = "bar"
   #sets default value for the var
   # if not provided , terraform will error out if value is not
   #  provided by the caller
   # could be any of supported data types
   # if Type is set - default must be of that type  

  description="example variable"
   #when moduled and published into registry  will be shown as documentation
   # simple comments for docs, like in any other thing like c# or ruby etc.
}

====Strings
basic key to value mapping (wut?) where key is the var name
  Example:
 variable "key" {
   type = "string"
   default = "value"
 }

  Multiline Example:
 variable "long_key" {
   type = "string"
   default = <<EOF
 This is a long key.
 Running over several lines.
 EOF
 }

====Maps
 AKA dictionary(c#) or hash-set(ruby)
 Collection of Key-value pairs
  Example:
 variable "images" {
   type = "map"
   default = {
     "us-east-1" = "image-1234"
     "us-west-2" = "image-456"
   }
 }

====List
 AKA array - ordered sequence of indexed items. Index is zero based.
  Example:
variable "users" {
  type = "list"
  default = ["admin", "ubuntu"]
}

====Booleans
 terraform does auto converion between strings and bools.
  But it is not recommended to use it [For Now!]:
 It is recommended to specify bool values for vars as strings:
  "true"
  "false"
 to avoid shit in conversion [In Future it should be ok and would be
  recommended way! ]
 stuff described in details here:
 https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#booleans

==PLAN
+ - indicates creation of resource
- - destroyed resource
~ - resource updated in-place (w/o destroying)
-/+ - destroyed and newly created resource

terraform plan - will read main.tf and display what is gonna happen

-var - adds/override variables into main.tf (like Properties in MSBuild)
	key-value pairs. 
	Could override existing variables
	Need add '-var' before every new entry
   Example:
  terraform plan -var region=eu-central-1 -- will override default variable
	'region', when it has us-west-1
	in Plan output it could be seen by using different AMIs
   Example1:
  terraform plan -var region=eu-central-1 -var profile=default

==APPLY

executes the .tf script creating stuff described in the file

--------------
Learn:

Parametrization:
 -Variables
 -Outputs

Interpolation Funcions:
something like work with strings - change, parse, cut etc. built-in terraform
engine

Modules:
encapsulates(seems like even private) configuration: DRY and shareble

Remote State:

---
some conventions and good practices:
- inputs goes into variables.tf file, not hardcoded in main.tf and stuff
  In main.tf add description(kinda comments ok?)
- outputs of the module goes into outputs.tf, so people know what a module
  returns
- resources creation goes into main.tf
- documentation about stuff goes into readme.md

==IoT

https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/6138 - started here
https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues/143  - completed here, still no iotAnalytics support it seems

==misc

call other exe\scripts in scope of terraform:
resource "null_resource" "attach_thing_to_certificate" {
  triggers {
    certificate_arn = "<certificate_arn>"
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "aws iot attach-thing-principal --thing-name <thing_name> --principal <certificate_arn> --region <region>"
  }
}
