Colors:
all the currently available colors are located in
/usr/share/vim/vim74/colors folder

to change color scheme for current session use:
  :color <shceme_name>
   :color desert

to have it loaded automatically add it into vimrc file like:
/etc/vimrc => :color desert

somewhy it does not work when adding ~/.vimrc file, probably it is no tloaded
for some reason, may be need to adjust some configs
