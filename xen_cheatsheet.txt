xen could be used not only through CLI but from GUI
Citrix develops XenCenter, which is windows based app
Xen Orchestra develops XOA, which is installed inside Xen, and then exposes
http access via web page

Xen stores .iso images in special repo, from which it could use them to 
create new VMs.

also it has bunch of VIF , which is V InterFace(virtual network adapters)


in VMware need to add Promiscuous mode when running, otherwise internet will
not work in xen virtual machines

to do so go here: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/287
in case of NAT use vmnet8 (actually use /dev/vmnet*)
chgrp newgroup /dev/vmnet0
chmod g+rw /dev/vmnet0
 NOTE:
make sure it vmnet devices still has right group and ownership, it resets
with restart if not set permanently
